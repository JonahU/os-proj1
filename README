-Not every string edge case is supported
    e.g. echo "hey ""jude"

-Input with invalid quotation marks will automatically fail the entire line of input
    e.g. echo """; pwd
    Even though pwd is valid, the whole line fails and nothing is executed

-Builtin commands work in parallel mode

-In parallel mode, builtin command "cd" runs in the parent process (different from a normal shell)
